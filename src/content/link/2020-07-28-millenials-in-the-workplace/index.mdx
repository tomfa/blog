Millennials have grown up in decades filled with instant gratification, parents telling them they're special and constant access to dopamine drips through cell phones and social media, Netflix and Spotify. This takes away from focus on things that take time: building meaningful relationships, self confidence, learning new skills and "making an impact" (whatever that means).

**Tips for millennials:**

- Leave your phone at home, off/silent when you go out with friends.
- Leave your phone outside your bedroom when you go to bed.
- Things that matter do not come easily nor pay off quickly: skills, love, relationships, self confidence and job satisfaction. **But don't forget to work on them.**
