_A side note: [A-Prettier-Formatter](http://jlongster.com/A-Prettier-Formatter) should be read. And if you're using Javascript, [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) should be tested (especially if you're using JSX)._

While ESLint eliminated the need for people to talk about code conventions, Prettier can eliminate the need for people to think about code formatting.

**10 000 thumbs up! I will never work for a company without autoformatting again.**
