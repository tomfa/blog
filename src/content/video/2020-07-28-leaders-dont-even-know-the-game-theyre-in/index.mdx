Empathy (the first 20 minutes) is more or less a duplicate of the previous video, Millennials in the workplace, and what they/we need from a workplace: trust and meaningful relationships. _Only difference is that his audience is now shifted from millennials themselves to their parent generation (which is interesting in itself, seeing how he phrases himself a bit differently)_ This is set up in contrast to typical 40 year old business theories like maximising shareholder value – _"It's like a coach prioritising the needs of the fans over the needs of the players"_.

Simon is great! He's pushing some really good values about caring for each other, patience and about leading with compassion and trust. I also love the moments where one word in his sentence comes out with an English dialect. He's so good at speaking that these short moments stand out :)
